# Introduction

Anomaly detection is a critical component in numerous domains, ranging from fraud detection and intrusion detection to system health monitoring and beyond. This project aims to provide an exceptional anomaly detection system that is both robust and flexible, capable of effectively handling a wide range of datasets. In this repository, you will find an advanced anomaly detection system specifically designed to identify unusual patterns or outliers within diverse datasets.

# Approaches

During the data experimentation phase, diverse approaches were tested. Including single algorithm testing, unconventional Hybrid appproaches and ensemble models. Various techniques, such as t-SNE and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) along with multiple encoding methods were utilized to remove dimensionality and improve interpretability.

# Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sarthak-sharma03/Hackathon-Project.git

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the anomaly detection system: python app.py

# Usage

Once the service is operational, you have the flexibility to specify the input dataset and select the suitable anomaly detection algorithm. The service will then process the data and present you with the identified anomalies. For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation.

# Dataset

The repository includes a sample dataset located in the data variable. You can replace it with your own dataset or use the provided data as a starting point for experimentation. Make sure your dataset is properly formatted and compatible with the selected anomaly detection algorithm.

# Algorithms
The repository supports multiple algorithms and ensemble approaches. Experimentation with several algorithms like, DAGMM, Deep SVDD, Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, GMM, and K-means Clustering has been done and most suitable ensemble model chosen.
